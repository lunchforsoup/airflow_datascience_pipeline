## TLDR
Avoid the regret of building Jupyter notebooks that end up in production,  pipelines all the way down for the win!


![Example Dag](dag_example.JPG)

## Goals
* Give Data Scientists a better way to start production data apps.
* Give Data Engineer better material for productionalization

## What's the point?
It's easy to implement ideas in jupyter, but it's difficult to implement Jupyter notebooks in production.  Produciton data apps need supportable and resilient data pipeline foundations.  Pipeline_gen helps you start your project with pipelines in mind.  

## Why Should You Care?
Depends on who you are:
* *just starting out in Data Science?* Do you want to make a good impression on Data Engineers during your technical interviews?  you set yourself apart by having at least breifly considered what the impacts of your future efforts may have on their weekends.
* *seasoned data scientist?*:  Hopefully you're already developing your EDA and model code with pipelines in mind.  Pipeline_gen forces / guides  you  to develop code that can be more easily scaled up by the data engineering team.
* *seasoned data engineer?* Pipeline_Gen shouldn't be the tool for your production pipelines, but if provided to your data scientists, it will guide them towards producing more deployable and scalable code, making your future self happier :)
* *full stack data scientist?* (aka data scientist and data engineer) - you can productionalize this under limited situations, and maybe hold you off until your employer can hire a real data engineer. 

## Design Principles
0. *Seprate the orchestration from the data processing* Airflow by default expects to run code on the Airflow python itself. It's better to perform all data processing on a docker image designed and built for that purpose.  Airflow's DockerOperator conveniently provides a great pairing of the orchestrator and the pipeline environment.
1. *Customize Sparingly* Do not add what is not critical to a basic data pipeline.  The code should deviate as little as possible from the most basic implementation of airflow
2. *Steer the user toward [good data pipelining practices](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/best-practices.html) such as atomicity and idemportency
3. *Keep the orchestrator out of the way* Airflow is an extremely powerful and flexible tool, but it can be daunting to new users who haven't considered the data engineering implications of data science deployemnt.
 4. *Make code development easy with Jupyter* The application spins up a [local Jupyter Environment](http://localhost:8888/) powered by the pipeline
 5. *Develop with Ops in mind* Use the [local Airflow](http://localhost:8080) to deploy, monitor, and troubleshoot your pipeline from inception

## Motivation
It's not easy to extract, refine, and transform raw data into production ML models.  It's much worse to keep models updated as data evolves over time.  It is much easier to start with the pipeline orchestration in mind.  You don't want to be in a position of having to rerun a Jupyter notebook to refresh production ML models.

I'd love to know if you have a *better* way to train models with airflow that doesn't take this approach!


## What this project ** is not **
Airflow has a world of capability that is not used in this project.  It can be deployed much more reliably than what is offered here. We're literally using a small fraction of it's capabilities with this project.  Importantly, this is *by design*. This project represents the step *between* a simple Jupyter EDA and a high availability, high throughput enterprise datapipeline.


## Prerequisites

To use this template, you'll need:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed on your system
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for cloning the repository

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/airflow-orchestration-environment.git
   cd airflow-orchestration-environment
   ```

2. **Build the Docker image**

   ```
   docker build -t yourusername/airflow-orchestration-environment .
   ```

3. **Start the Airflow environment**

   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   This command will start the Airflow web server, scheduler, and all necessary components in separate containers.

4. **Access the Airflow web interface**

   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`. You should see the Airflow web interface with no pipelines.

## Usage

### Creating a New Data Pipeline

1. Create a new Python script in the `dags` folder following the naming convention `your_dag_name.py`.

2. Define your data pipeline using Airflow's [Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/concepts/dags.html) and [task](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/concepts/tasks.html) objects. For example:

   ```python
   from datetime import datetime, timedelta
   from airflow import DAG
   from airflow.operators.python_operator import PythonOperator

   def print_hello():
       print("Hello from your first task!")

   default_args = {
       "owner": "airflow",
       "depends_on_past": False,
       "email_on_failure": False,
       "email_on_retry": False,
       "retries": 1,
       "retry_delay": timedelta(minutes=5),
   }

   dag = DAG(
       "hello_world",
       default_args=default_args,
       description="A simple hello world DAG",
       schedule_interval=timedelta(days=1),
       start_date=datetime(2023, 4, 16),
       catchup=False,
   )

   t1 = PythonOperator(
       task_id="print_hello",
       python_callable=print_hello,
       dag=dag,
   )
   ```

3. Save the file, and the new pipeline will automatically appear in the Airflow web interface.

### Updating an Existing Data Pipeline

To update an existing pipeline, simply modify the corresponding Python script in the `dags` folder and save your changes. Airflow will automatically update the pipeline in the web interface.

### Updating the Application

To modify the app (add packages, update port numbers, etc), simply make the changes (protip: make only 1 change at a time), then restart the app:

```
docker-compose down; ./clean_docker.sh ; ./build_pipeline_image.sh ; docker-compose up
```

## Contributing

Want to add tooling that will help monitor and deploy models, such as Tensorboard, Weights and Biases, and maybe Prometheus and Grafana.
